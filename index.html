										<h2>Hello Everyone!</h2>

He also composed soundtrack for the movies “Red Pannier”, "Large Running River ", "Drizzly Spring Rain", "Wedding" etc.
In 1980 Mr. Wang went to Japan to become a fellow of the Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation where he delivered lectures on "Comparison of the Chinese and the Okinawan folk tune styles"; while at Keio University he worked and presented a research study report on the Chinese minority folk tune style. Mr. Wang became professor and deputy dean of the Japan International Academy of Music, and he was also the music director of the Japanese "Rope Seat" and "Ghost Dance" theatre companies. His works include: "Shima" "Journey to the West", "Son of the Sun", "Sohrab White Horse", etc. He also produced the Japanese shakuhachi and koto duo (premiered by a famous Japanese shakuhachi player Kifu Mitsuhashi), "Morning in Dongzhai," "Ambush on All Sides" (played by Japanese Music Group) and other works. The Tokyo Casals Hall had held the" Wang YanQiao music concerts. "
Immigrated to Canada in 1991, Mr. Wang continued in music composing, teaching and conducting. The Toronto and Ottawa Symphony Orchestras had played his New Year overture. During the last century, Mr. Wang’s works include the ballet "Ancient Fantasy", erhu concerto "Melody of a Hundred Birds", chamber music "Artux Folksong", and choral works "Three Character Classic", " Nostalgia", "Ah! China" and so on.
In recent years, apart from giving lectures in Beijing, Xinjiang, Wuhan and other places, Mr. Wang composed and conducted national choral concerts in Xinjiang; composed and directed large-scale symphonic visual concerts "Beautiful Country" in Hebei. For the CCOM Anniversary celebration concert, he composed six piano pieces and directed the performance by 12 famous piano professors, including Zhou Guangren, Guo Zhihong, Li Qifang, Chen Bigang, Wu Ying and others. In March 2011, Mr. Wang’s large-scale symphonic visual concert “Sound of Taihe” was performed by the National Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Li Xincao in a CCTV televised concert at the China National Grand Theatre. In late 2014, Mr. Wang was commissioned by Toronto’s New Music Concerts to compose a chamber music piece – Guizhou Qing Shui Jiang at Night – for their concert by Chinese and Canadian composers held in February 2015.

In 2013 and early 2014, he was commissioned by the Cultural Federation of Hainan Province to compose the "Coconut Island Charm - Hainan Folk Choral Suite" which will be premiered in Hainan at the end of 2015.
In addition to composing and teaching, Mr. Wang, with a strong interest in music theory, has spent lots of efforts on studying folk and primitive music and of their relationship to the peoples and cultures around several regions in China.
